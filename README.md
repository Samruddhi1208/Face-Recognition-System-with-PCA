# Face-Recognition-System-with-PCA
It is a Face Recognition System created with the help of PCA, for face detection and feature extraction. 
I have trained it with a dataset of face images, of different actors and actresses.
Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, etc. are the libraries used.
I used PCA to plot eigenfaces, then also plotted a gallery of portraits in gray scale.
After creating a MLP Classifier model, and training it with a number of iterations, it can make predictions of names of faces.
In the testing, I plotted a classification report, confusion matrix and a sns heatmap denoting the true positives or false negatives of predictions. This way the accuracy can also be determined.
